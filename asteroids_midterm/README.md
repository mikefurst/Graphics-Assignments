# Asteroids midterm

This purpose of this assignment was to implement a clone of the original asteroids game.

My code can be found in the modified files source/main.cpp, source/Ship.h, source/Ship.cpp and in the created files source/Bullet.h, source/Explosion.h, source/GameSettings.h, and source/Hexagon.h .

More information for using the finished assignment can be found below:

HOW TO PLAY:
	CONTROLS:
	  GAMEPLAY:
		USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS TO MOVE
		PRESS SPACE TO THRUST FORWARD
		USE SHIFT TO REVERSE THRUST AND SLOW DOWN
		PRESS Z TO FIRE MISSILES
	  SETTINGS:
		PRESS F1 TO TOGGLE THE DRAW MODE
			DEFAULT = OUTLINE
			TOGGLE MODE = FILL
		PRESS F2 TO TOGGLE BETWEEN MAXIMUM MISSILE VALUES - USE IF FIRING TOO MANY MISSILE SLOWS DOWN YOUR SYSTEM
			MISSILE LEVEL STARTS AT LOW, TOGGLES BETWEEN:
				MINIMUM
				LOW
				MEDIUM
				HIGH
				BULLET HELL
		PRESS F3 TO TOGGLE THE BOUNDS MODE - USE THIS TO SPEED UP THE GAME AT THE COST OF COLISION ACCURACY
			DEFAULT MODE = FULL SHAPE - SLOWER BUT MORE ACCURATE
			TOGGLE MODE = BOUNDING BOX - FASTER BUT LESS ACCURATE
		PRESS F4 TO TOGGLE LIMITING EXPLOSIONS - USE THIS TO SPEED UP THE GAME IF IT SLOWS DOWN WHEN THERE ARE TOO MANY
		EXPLOSIONS ON SCREEN
			DEFAULT MODE = ON - EXPLOSIONS LIMITED TO SAME AMOUNT AS MAXIMUM BULLETS
			TOGGLE MODE = OFF - NO CAP FOR MAXIMUM EXPLOSIONS
		PRESS F5 TO TOGGLE EXPLOSION EFFECTS - USE THIS TO SPEED UP THE GAME IF TOO SLOW
			DEFAULT MODE = ON - EXPLOSIONS WILL DECREASE THE SIZE OF AN ASTEROID WHEN COLIDING
			TOGGLE MODE = OFF - EXPLOSIONS WILL BE IGNORED AND ARE JUST THERE TO LOOK PRETTY
	GAMEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS:
		USING THE CONTROLS NAVIGATE THE SCREEN TO AVOID THE ASTEROIDS, YOU CAN USE MISSILES TO DESTROY THE ASTEROIDS, BUT
		BE CAREFUL - LARGER ASTEROIDS WILL BREAK APART, AND THEIR SMALLER PIECES WILL MOVE MUCH FASTER. THE EXPLOSIONS OF
		YOUR MISSILES MAY ALSO HELP YOU OUT, AS THEY CHIP AWAY AT THE SIZE OF THE ASTEROID, MAKING IT LES LIKELY FOR THEIR
		TO BE LEFTOVER PIECES OF ASTEROID ONCE YOU SHOOT IT. BE CAREFUL THOUGH, EACH ASTEROID THAT HITS YOUR SHIP WILL 
		DECREASE ITS DURABILITY, A VALUE YOU CAN MONITOR WITH THE BAR BELOW YOUR SHIP. SINCE YOU ARE ALL ALONE, YOU CANNOT
		INCREASE YOUR DURABILITY, SO DON'T HOPE TO EVER SEE THE BAR GET LARGER, IT ONLY GETS SMALLER.
		GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
