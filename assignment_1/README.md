# Assignment 1

Shapes and Color

This assignment has several components each bound to a key press:

Key: 1
	Draw a light blue square with a black outline
Key: 2
	Draw a rainbow circle that changes smoothly on the outside from red to green to blue to red
Key: 3
	Instead of drawing a rainbow circle in RGB like for key 2, draw a rainbow circle in HSV values instead

Additional keys outside of the assignment:

Key: Up
	Change to next shape
Key: Enter 
	Toggle animation (automatically move between shapes)
Key: 4
	Draw a hexagon that changes smoothly through the RGB colors.
